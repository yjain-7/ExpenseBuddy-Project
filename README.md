Expense-Buddy is a powerful debt simplification tool designed to help groups manage shared expenses efficiently. Whether you're splitting bills with roommates, planning a group trip, or managing team expenses, Expense-Buddy streamlines the process and minimizes the hassle of settling debts.

## Features

- **Group Creation**: Easily create and manage groups with multiple users.
- **Expense Management**: Add expenses and split them among group members with flexible options.
- **Debt Simplification**: Reduce the number of transactions needed to settle debts within the group.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and expense tracking.

## Upcoming Feature

## How It Works

Consider a group with three users: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The initial debts are as follows:
- Alice owes Bob $50
- Alice owes Charlie $20
- Bob owes Charlie $30

Without simplification, there would be three transactions:
1. Alice pays Bob $50
2. Alice pays Charlie $20
3. Bob pays Charlie $30

With Expense-Buddy's simplification feature, the transactions are reduced to:
1. Alice pays Bob $20
2. Alice pays Charlie $50

This simplification minimizes the number of transactions while ensuring that everyone is paid what they are owed.
